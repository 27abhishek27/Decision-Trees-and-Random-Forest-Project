# Decision Trees and Random Forest Project

## üìå Overview
This project applies **Decision Trees and Random Forest** algorithms to predict whether a borrower will fully repay a loan using LendingClub data (2007-2010). The model aims to assist investors in making informed lending decisions based on borrower profiles. The dataset contains loan-related features that influence repayment behavior, and this project explores how machine learning models can classify loan repayment risk.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **LendingClub loan data (2007-2010)**, obtained from [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action). It contains details about loans and borrowers, including:
- `credit.policy`: Whether the borrower meets LendingClub's credit criteria.
- `purpose`: Loan purpose category.
- `int.rate`: Interest rate of the loan.
- `installment`: Monthly installment amount.
- `fico`: FICO credit score.
- `revol.util`: Revolving line utilization rate.
- `not.fully.paid`: Target variable (1 if the loan was not fully paid back).

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/27abhishek27/Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest-Project.git
cd Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest-Project
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîç Methodology
### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Handling Missing Values**: Checked for missing values and handled them using imputation techniques where necessary.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converted the `purpose` column into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features such as `int.rate` and `installment` for better model performance.
- **Train-Test Split**: Divided the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing data.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Distribution of Loan Repayment Status**: Visualized the proportion of fully paid vs. not fully paid loans.
- **FICO Score vs Loan Repayment**: Analyzed trends between credit scores and repayment behavior.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified relationships between numerical variables.
- **Boxplots and Histograms**: Explored distributions of `int.rate`, `installment`, and `revol.util` among different loan statuses.

### 3. **Model Training**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Built an initial decision tree model to understand feature splits.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Implemented an ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used `GridSearchCV` to find optimal depth and number of estimators.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- **Classification Metrics**: Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Assessed false positives and false negatives in predictions.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identified top contributing factors to loan repayment predictions.

## üìä Visualizations
All generated plots and graphs are stored in the `visualizations/` folder. These include:
- **Histogram of two FICO distributions on top of each other, one for each credit.policy outcome.

- **Histogram of two FICO distributions on top of each other the not.fully.paid column.
